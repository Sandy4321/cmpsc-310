So when I was younger I cut, and burned myself, and pulled out my hair. It was a secret. I mean I hid it from most people, only shared it with my closest friends. I wrote poetry about blood and pain and all.<br />And later tattoos, S/M and bondage replaced the razor blades under the bed.<br />Then it all just sort of faded away. <br />I guess I was sick.<br />I never got help.<br />But anyways I have been thinking back and I  think  the REAL reason I cut myself was to rebel.<br />I mean not directly, because i did hide it.<br />I think maybe I was rebelling on a big scale. Kinda like... people are afraid of blood and pain, and little girls are supposed to be sweet and pretty. So I was proving to myself that I was different.<br /> That I was better even.<br />Blood and pain didnt scare me.  I mean it was hard being a teenager, I hated the way the world had all these plans for me and just had to go along. at the time it all felt personal, but looking back I see that I was experiencing something bigger. I think the pain is almost innate in 15 year old girls... Anyways by abusing my flesh I expressed myself, I defined my self. I made my own rules and proved to myself that my body was MINE and belonged to no one else. <br />I didnt care what anyone thought,<br />I needed to find out what I thought, you see?<br />I didnt have another way to claim myself at that time. <br />And yes it turned me on.<br /> and yes I cried about it.<br />but thats cuz it was real, its what I needed.<br />I am who I am today because of it and I feel like it was a healthy part of my growth. <br />I know it scared my mom,<br />but fu(k its not my fault the world is so lost. <br />Maybe if we had some myth and ritual to get us through those times.<br /> Something to validate how hard coming from child to women can be. <br />Some recondition that we are individuals <br />maybe we would have to write our own....  I dont ever even think about hurting myself now. <br />I dont even want any more tattoos.<br />I cant take the pain. <br />I dont need it anymore<br />But I love my scars<br />and I remember those dark, red, sad, times<br />with love.<br />Im grateful for my past and my path and<br />I still dont care what anyone thinks <u>Mixed Emotions and Bold Print</u> [3-24-04]<br /><br />and you looked inside<br />and saw nothing<br />but my heart beating for you<br />breathing so softly<br />just waiting for you to come back<br />hold me in your arms again<br />and tell me it's going to be alright<br />make me feel secure and safe<br />knowing there's someone who cares if<br /><b>I'm still around the next day</b><br /><br />searching for a reason<br />searching for a breath<br />and gasping for air<br />looking for a way out <br />to go back in to what was there<br />questioning these answers<br />and answering their questions<br />understanding what they don't know<br />staring back like I haven't got a clue<br /><b>waiting for the phone to ring</b><br /><br />comprehend this and look around<br />can you see what I see?<br />can you feel what I feel?<br />I can see it all while you stand there blindly<br />it's all or nothing<br />it's everything and anything at all<br />beautiful distaster<br />you're chemical romance<br />exploding from mixed feelings<br /><b>do you get it?</b><br /><br />round and around<br />circles and squares<br />in and out, through and through<br />you left and came back and then left again<br />playing with my emotions<br />like a ball on a string infront of a cat<br />fearless and fearful<br />together all the less<br /><b>through thick and thin<br />you said you'd be there</b><br /><br />no rhyme and no reason<br />for why I feel this way<br />just wishing and waiting<br />and wasting my time away<br />loveless and lonely<br />surrounded and happy<br />feelings for you why I feel this way<br />all my senses and nonsense<br />and I can't understand<br /><b>why I love you and can't let you go</b>
